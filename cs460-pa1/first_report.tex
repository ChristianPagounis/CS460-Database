  \section{Assumptions}
  In the Users table, we store a password hash to avoid storing cleartext
  passwords.  In testing with SHA-256 encryption, as suggested on Piazza, this
  hash appears to be just short of 80 characters.  It would be bad to
  accidentally mutilate the hash, however, so this field has some extra space,
  just in case.

  In the final section of the schema, we have several triggers to easily update
  a user's contribution score.  The removal triggers, in particular, are hooked
  up to the appropriate relationship tables, because it would be unfair for a
  user to maintain their high contribution score if they were to delete a great
  number of their photos, or if others delete photos on which they have
  commented, because there would then no longer be proof of their contributions.

  Using only SQL, it is difficult to prevent a user from commenting on their own
  photo.  As such, this logic will have to be implemented in Flask instead.
  This does incur some lag for the end-user, but that's preferable to writing
  convoluted SQL in an attempt to make the language perform a task for which it
  was never designed.

  Using only SQL, it is also difficult to make sure that a user cannot become
  friends with themselves somehow.  Obviously, no one should be able to befriend
  themselves, because that makes no sense.  However, SQL treats a set of columns
  (1, 2) as identical to the set (2, 1), which goes against the application's
  semantics.  So this, too, will have to be done in Python.

  In addition to the entity and relationship tables, we have created a view to
  calculate the users with the highest contribution scores.  We could have
  stored this as a true table, but contribution scores are likely to change
  quickly.  As such, it makes more sense to just recalculate the top-10 list on
  the fly, saving us the effort of constantly keeping another table up-to-date.
